# AML (DAT341) Project

This repository contains assignments for the Applied Machine Learning (DAT341) course.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv sklearn-env
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     sklearn-env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source sklearn-env/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -U scikit-learn
   ```

   Note: If you need Jupyter Notebook, also install it with:
   ```
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Running the Assignments

- Navigate to the `PA1/` directory.
- Open `PA1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the cells to execute the assignment.

## Data

- `CTG.csv`: Dataset used in PA1.
